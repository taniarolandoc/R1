Product Requirements Document â€“ TastyFund (Restaurant Investment Crowdfunding Platform)

1. Overview
TastyFund is a digital platform that enables investment crowdfunding for startup and small-sized restaurants to raise targeted funds for specific operational goals. The platform addresses the critical financing gap faced by small restaurants that struggle to access traditional financing due to strict lending requirements, lack of collateral, and limited financial history. By connecting restaurants with community investors through a verified crowdfunding system, TastyFund ensures transparency, tracks progress through milestones, and delivers measurable results.

The platform integrates blockchain technology for transparent transactions, secure identity verification, and tracking of capital use, building a trust-based network between investors and restaurant owners while aligning with decentralized finance principles.

2. Problem Statement
Small and startup restaurants face significant challenges securing investment for business growth. Traditional financial institutions require strong credit histories, collateral, or detailed financial tracks that most small businesses cannot provide. In Korea specifically, banks prioritize mortgage and household lending over small businesses - in 2024, Korean banks faced $1.8 billion USD in penalties for failing SME loan quotas, revealing structural inconsistency between stated support and actual lending behavior. This funding gap forces reliance on third-party lenders and creates business viability risks - only 10% of medium-sized companies reported financial improvement, with many facing illiquidity risks.
